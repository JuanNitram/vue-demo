# Getting started

Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

## Vuex

Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. It also integrates with Vue's official devtools extension (opens new window)to provide advanced features such as zero-config time-travel debugging and state snapshot export / import.

## Axios

Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Trust me, this will be an useful library. Take a look here: https://github.com/axios/axios

## Devtools

The Vue.js devtools allows you to inspect and debug your applications. Take a look here: https://devtools.vuejs.org/

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
